# PWA Icon Setup Instructions

To complete the PWA setup for Feeel Web, you need to create proper PNG icon files:

## Required Steps:

1. Create a square icon image (recommended 512x512 pixels) with your app's logo
2. Save it as `src/assets/feeel-icon.png`

## Icon Specifications:
- Format: PNG
- Size: At least 192x192 pixels (512x512 recommended)
- Shape: Square
- Background: Preferably with transparency or a solid background that matches your theme

## Example Creation Process:
You can use an online tool or image editor to create the icon:

1. Open your preferred image editor
2. Create a new 512x512 pixel canvas
3. Add your logo or design
4. Export as PNG format
5. Save as `src/assets/feeel-icon.png`

## Alternative Online Tools:
- Figma
- Canva

After creating the icon file, the Vite PWA plugin will automatically generate all necessary icon sizes during the build process.
